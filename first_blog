<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
<p>“Where Do Trees Grow” project examines the gap between New York City’s ambitious tree canopy expansion goals and the long-term care required to sustain them. While trees provide critical benefits—such as reducing urban heat, absorbing stormwater, and improving public health—the burden of their maintenance often falls to underfunded city agencies and volunteers. Through visual documentation, the project will photograph neglected tree beds as well as document areas near subway stops with limited canopy coverage across the five boroughs. Ultimately, the project seeks to reframe urban trees from “nice to have” amenities into essential infrastructure deserving of sustained public investment.</p>
