  <h2>Project Concept: Street Trees of NYC</h2>
  <p>This flyer is part of the "Stree Trees of NYC" project that examines the gap between New York City’s ambitious tree canopy expansion goals and the long-term care required to sustain them. While trees provide critical benefits—such as reducing urban heat, absorbing stormwater, and improving mental well-being—their long-term maintenance often falls to underfunded city agencies and volunteers. This project will raise awareness for the value of trees and encourage communities to care for their street trees. The following flyers is to be distributed to neighborhoods across all New York City boroughs, especially those areas that have seen an increase in newly planted trees.</p>
